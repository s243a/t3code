# Fork-local design docs

Documents specific to the `s243a/t3code` fork. They live here rather than in
`docs/internals/` — which upstream owns — so provenance stays obvious and
rebases against upstream stay clean. Nothing here is proposed upstream.

## Goal

Run the Antigravity CLI (`agy`) from a phone, through T3 Code.

## Options, in the order they should be considered

### 1. T3's existing terminal — shipped, zero code

Open a thread terminal on the machine where `agy` lives and type `agy`.

Works on the same machine as the T3 server or a different one, because T3
expresses remoteness at the connection layer: one server per machine, and a
client holds many saved environments and connects to each directly. Desktop can
even start a remote server over SSH and pair it
([remote access](../user/remote-access.md), Option 3).

Terminal scrollback is persisted to disk and replayed on reattach, so this
survives disconnects. **Start here.** It costs nothing to find out whether it is
already enough.

Limits: a terminal is a terminal — no approval cards, no per-turn checkpointing,
no thread history. `agy`'s permission prompts are answered by typing into its
TUI, including the ctrl+g expansion needed to read truncated commands before
approving them.

### 2. ACP bridge — the way to get a real T3 provider

[mcp-to-acp-bridge.md](./mcp-to-acp-bridge.md)

Two routes to making `agy` speak ACP, which is what T3's provider layer
consumes:

- **Route A, MCP-gated bridge.** Intercept the agent's MCP tool calls and expose
  them as ACP, turning each call into a permission request. Agent-agnostic;
  likely its own repository (working name `MCP-to-ACP`).
- **Route B, `agy`'s local Connect API.** Higher potential fidelity, one agent
  only, unverified.

Route A has a minimum viable form with no open prerequisites: gate the agent's
MCP calls as ACP permission requests and take assistant prose from stdout, while
the agent keeps its built-in tools. Routing built-ins through MCP as well is
later hardening — it buys per-action review instead of standing grants, and is
not needed to ship.

### 3. Generic ACP driver — design

[generic-acp-driver.md](./generic-acp-driver.md)

A T3 driver that speaks only the open Agent Client Protocol, so it can drive any
ACP agent — including the bridge above — with no vendor methods in its core.

Written to be upstream-able. Vendor knowledge lives in **profiles**, which are
data: a named bundle of command, args, env, capabilities and models. Adding an
agent is a config entry, never a new adapter.

Why not reuse an existing driver: `CursorAdapter.ts` carries
`cursor/list_available_models`, `cursor/ask_question`, `cursor/create_plan` and
`cursor/update_todos`. Those are vendor extensions, not ACP, and matching them
would mean impersonating another vendor's product in a public repository.

### 4. Peer fabric — proposal

[t3-p2p-proposal.md](./t3-p2p-proposal.md)

What a P2P layer for T3 should do, at the level of intent rather than
mechanism. The gap it addresses is **provisioning**, not transport: before a
client can connect to a machine, something has to be running there, and today
that means opening a shell and configuring an address by hand.

Central principle: a peer offers _capabilities_ ("this machine will run a
broker for you"), never access. A peer that runs arbitrary commands is a remote
shell wearing a fabric costume.

### 5. Broker PTY adapter — documented, not recommended

[agy-broker-pty.md](./agy-broker-pty.md)

Relay T3's `PtyAdapter` to the SciREPL broker's `/term` endpoint. Written when
option 1 was believed not to cover cross-host; **it does**, so the transport
argument for this is gone.

Retained because the constraint analysis is accurate and the narrow remaining
argument — privilege surface, a machine where you want `agy` reachable but not a
general-purpose remote dev server — may become concrete later.

## Status

Options 2 and 3 are built; option 1 never needed building.

- **Option 2 — the bridge** lives at
  [`s243a/mcp-acp-bridge`](https://github.com/s243a/mcp-acp-bridge), a separate
  repository so its churn stays out of this fork's diff. Route A is what
  shipped. It went further than the minimum described above: turns travel over
  MCP rather than being typed at a TUI, execution can be gated as an MCP tool so
  the command text is reviewed before it runs, and permission questions arrive
  on two channels — the tool channel, and the agent's own terminal prompts as a
  fallback. Its `docs/design.md` carries what agy actually does, most of it
  learned the hard way.
- **Option 3 — the generic ACP driver** is on the `claude/generic-acp-driver`
  branch: driver, adapter, contracts and tests, with vendor knowledge as data
  exactly as designed here.
- **Option 5 — the broker PTY adapter** remains documented and unbuilt.

Route A's working name `MCP-to-ACP` became `mcp-acp-bridge`. The "later
hardening" of routing built-ins through MCP is no longer hypothetical: it ships
as the `agy-dual-gated` profile, and the reason it matters is recorded there —
a shell granted by name cannot be reviewed, since nothing in "RunCommand"
distinguishes `-exec stat` from `-exec rm -rf`.
